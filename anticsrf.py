        Register a new anti-CSRF token with the global dictionary.
        Tokens expire 1 hour (3600 seconds) after they are issued.
        Before registering the new token, expired ones are purged.

        Manually expire a token before its 1 hour limit.

            that we can expire old tokens at every possible moment.

        Effects:    modifies the module-global registry of tokens, possibly

        Filter out expired tokens from the registry, by only leaving those
            tokens which expire in the future.

        Arguments:  a token (string)
        Returns:    True or False, based on whether the given token is in fact
            registered and valid
        Throws:     TypeError if the value at ANTICSRF_REGISTER[tok] is not
            orderable with int (i.e, not a number), and anything thrown
            by clean_expired()
        Effects:    any side effects of clean_expired()

        Test whether a token is valid (registered).
        Unpythonically, this function does not let a KeyError be raised if the
            token is not a key; this is because we clean out expired
            tokens first, so they no longer exist by the time the condition is
            tested.
        While it is possible a token could expire after the call to
            clean_expired() but before the condition is checked, this is
            extremely unlikely -- but the code is probably redundant just to
            be safe anyways.
